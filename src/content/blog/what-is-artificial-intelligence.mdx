## Blog Summary

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the science of building machines that can mimic or simulate human intelligence—such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Coined in 1956 at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project by John McCarthy, the term marked the birth of a new field distinct from earlier work in cybernetics. Over time, AI has evolved from symbolic rule-based systems to data-driven machine learning and deep learning models.

This blog provides a comprehensive introduction to AI, tracing its philosophical and mathematical origins, explaining the differences between AI, machine learning, and deep learning, and unpacking various types of AI—from narrow AI to the hypothetical superintelligence. It also covers key milestones, from Turing's Imitation Game and the invention of the perceptron to the breakthroughs of AlphaGo, GPT, and beyond.

By the end, you'll gain clarity on what AI really means, how it developed, where it stands today, and what you need to know to hold your own in any AI conversation.

        The term 'Artificial Intelligence' was coined by John McCarthy during the seminal 1956 Dartmouth Summer AI Project. He deliberately chose 'Artificial Intelligence' to differentiate this emerging field from 'Cybernetics', another popular research domain at the time focused primarily on control and communication in biological and mechanical systems.

**Artificial Intelligence, or AI, is a field of Computer Science which broadly focuses on creating machines that exhibit 'intelligence'.**

Intelligence typically refers to the ability to perceive, reason, learn, and adapt—qualities that enable humans to perform tasks requiring cognition, decision-making, problem-solving, and effective interaction with their environment.
<br />
As you may have noticed by now, the definition of Artificial Intelligence is intentionally vague. This vagueness arises primarily because reaching a universally agreeable definition of AI has been challenging, making it what Marvin Minsky aptly described as a 'suitcase-word'. Marvin Minsky, one of the original AI pioneers and a participant in the seminal 1956 Dartmouth Summer AI Project, used this term to highlight how AI encompasses a diverse set of ideas, methods, and applications packed into a single term, each carrying a slightly different meaning depending on context. According to Minsky, AI indeed suffers from a 'packaging problem', holding multiple definitions simultaneously.

Interestingly, the absence of a universally accepted, precise definition of AI has been both a challenge and a boon. As highlighted by Stanford's influential 'One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence' (2016), this lack of strict boundaries has allowed AI to grow, evolve, and advance at an accelerating pace. Practitioners, researchers, and developers navigate this field guided primarily by a general sense of direction and urgency rather than strict definitions.

Since the 2010s, however, popular media has increasingly associated AI almost exclusively with 'Deep Learning' (neural networks). This narrow view represents an unfortunate oversimplification and inaccuracy, as Melanie Mitchell points out in her book Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans. Deep Learning is indeed a powerful subset of Machine Learning, which itself is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Nevertheless, equating AI solely with Deep Learning overlooks the field's broader complexity and variety.

AI fundamentally comprises diverse methodologies aiming to create machine 'intelligence', making it critical to keep the suitcase-word concept in mind for a complete understanding.

To clarify AI further, here are several definitions from prominent figures and organisations:

- Herbert Simon (participant in the 1956 Dartmouth Summer AI Project), in his seminal paper, <cite>Artificial Intelligence: An Empirical Science (1995)[^1]</cite>, defined AI as:
    
    > A branch of computer science that studies the properties of intelligence by synthesizing intelligence.

- Nils J. Nilsson, in <cite>The Quest for Artificial Intelligence: A History of Ideas and Achievements (2010)[^2]</cite>, describes AI as:
    
    > Artificial intelligence is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment.

- Google – <cite>Introduction to Generative AI[^3]</cite>:
    
    > AI is the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.

- Microsoft <cite>Azure AI Fundamentals[^4]</cite>:
    
    > AI is software that imitates human behaviours and capabilities.

## Brief History of AI

While the history of Artificial Intelligence has been closely intercoiled with the history of computing there are some significant points in history that are worth noting:

**1950: Alan Turing publishes <cite>Computing Machinery and Intelligence[^5]</cite>**

Relevance: A profound thought experiment to assess a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviours indistinguishable from that of humans. Introduced the famous "Turing Test" i.e. "The Imitation Game", a crucial concept for evaluating machine intelligence and setting the early philosophical groundwork for AI.

<div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4 my-6">
  <div class="flex">
    <div class="ml-3">
      <p class="text-sm text-yellow-700">
        <strong>💡 Did You Know?</strong><br />
        The Imitation Game (now known as the Turing Test) was first described as below by Alan Turning:

        **🕹️  The Imitation Game Setup**
        
       _Three players:_

        - _A (man)_
        - _B (woman)_
        - _C (interrogator) — of any gender._
        
        _Game mechanics:_
        
        _The interrogator (C) is in a separate room and communicates with A and B via a text-based interface (e.g., typewritten messages), so that physical voice or appearance gives no clues._
        
        _The goal of the interrogator is to determine which is the man and which is the woman._
        
        _The man (A) will try to deceive the interrogator, while the woman (B) will try to help the interrogator make the correct identification._
        
        _Turing's proposal:_
        
        _Replace player A (the man) with a machine._
        
        _Now the test becomes: Can the interrogator distinguish between the machine and the human (B)?_

        **Barbara Grosz**, an AI pioneer on the topic of natural communication between people and machines, proposed a **modern version of the Turing Test** in 2012:

        > A computer (agent) team member [that can] behave, over the long term and in uncertain, dynamic environments, in such a way that people on the team will not notice that it is not human.
      </p>

## Types of AI

There are many ways in which AI can be categorised, we will explore a number of types/classifications of AI:

### I. By Intelligence Capability (How Smart It Is)

This categorization shows how "intelligent" the AI is in comparison to human intelligence:
1. **ANI – Artificial Narrow Intelligence (a.k.a. Weak AI)**
    
    Definition: AI that's good at one specific task.
    
    Examples: ChatGPT, Google Translate, Netflix recommendations, facial recognition.
    
    Limitations: Can't perform tasks outside its training or "switch" contexts.

2. **AGI – Artificial General Intelligence (a.k.a. Strong AI)**

    Definition: AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can do.

    Examples: Still hypothetical. Think Iron Man's JARVIS or the movie Her.

    Abilities: Can learn, reason, adapt, and generalize knowledge across domains.

3. **ASI – Artificial Superintelligence**

    Definition: AI that is smarter than the best human minds in every field.

    Examples: Theoretical. Future concept—might have its own goals or consciousness.

    Concerns: Raises ethical questions about control, alignment, and safety.

### II. By Learning & Representation (How It Thinks or Learns)

This explains how the AI works under the hood—how it reasons or makes decisions:
1. **Symbolic AI (Rule-based or Logic-driven)**

    Definition: Uses clearly defined rules and logic to make decisions.

    Example: Expert systems, chess programs from the 1980s.

    Analogy: Teaching a child "If it's raining, take an umbrella."

2. **Sub-Symbolic AI (Learning-based)**

    Definition: Learns from patterns in data rather than rules.
    
    Example: Neural networks, deep learning, computer vision.
    
    Analogy: Showing a child 10,000 pictures of cats until they recognize cats.

### III. By Application Scope (Where It Can Be Used)**

This shows how broadly the AI can apply its intelligence:
1. **Narrow AI (Same as ANI)**

    Focus: One domain, one problem.

    Reality: All current commercial AI fits here.

2. **General AI (Same as AGI)**

    Focus: Any domain, like a human mind.

    Reality: Still under research.

3. **Super AI (Same as ASI)**

    Focus: Beyond human capability.

    Reality: Future speculation.

**🔁 Quick Mapping**

| Capability Type | Intelligence    | Learning Approach        | Scope         | Status         |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|---------------|----------------|
| ANI             | Weak/Narrow     | Symbolic or Sub-symbolic | Task-specific | Already exists |
| AGI             | General         | Likely Sub-symbolic      | Broad         | In development |
| ASI             | Superhuman      | Unknown                  | Universal     | Theoretical    |

## Key Terms

This section focuses on some of key terms an AI practitioner should be familiar with. We have tried to cover some of the common jargon so that the readers can be familiar with AI and can hold themselves in a technical conversation.

**Machine Learning:** 

Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence. The fundamental idea of Machine Learning is to use data from past observations and learn to predict future outcomes or recognise patterns.

**Supervised Machine Learning:** 

Machine Learning where algorithms learn from labelled datasets. For example: Predicting house prices based on historical data (regression), classifying emails as 'spam' or 'not spam'(Classification), and facial recognition(Classification).

**Unsupervised Machine Learning:** 

Machine Learning methods that identify patterns or groupings in datasets without explicit labels or pre-existing answers. For example: Grouping customers based on buying behaviour (Clustering), recommending products to users based on similar preferences (Collaborative Filtering)

**Semi-supervised learning:** 

A blend of supervised and unsupervised learning, using both labelled and unlabeled data to train algorithms. For example: Large Language Models

**Deep Learning:** 

Deep Learning is an advanced subfield of Machine Learning that tries to emulate how the human brain works. At its core are artificial Neural Networks, mathematical models designed to mimic the electrochemical signals transmitted by biological neurons.

Broadly, Deep Learning methods fall  into two categories:

_Discriminative Deep Learning: Models that classify or distinguish data into predefined categories. For example: recognising objects within images_

_Generative Deep Learning: Models capable of creating new content based on learned patterns. For example: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Gemini that generate coherent and contextually relevant text._

**Neural Networks:** 

Networks of interconnected Artificial Neurons designed to mimic biological brain structure. It is essentially defining deeply nested functions. They're fundamental to Deep Learning

**Generative AI:** 

Generative AI (or GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content. A sub field of Deep Learning.

**Computer Vision:** 
An AI that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information (like images or videos)

**Natural Language Processing:** 

An AI disciple that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.

**Large Language Models (LLMSs):** 

Specialised type of machine learning models that you can use to perform natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models are trained on vast amount of text data to understand, generate, and interact naturally using human language (e.g. GPT - Generative PreTrained Transformers)

**Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs):** 

Specialised type of Neural Networks particularly suited for image and video processing tasks, capable of recognising patterns such as shapes, edges, and colours.

**Transformers:** 

Neural Network architecture especially effective at handling text data, which uses 'attention mechanisms' to understand context and relationships within data.

Transformer model architecture consists of two components or blocks: 

_Encoder block - creates semantic representations of the training vocabulary._ 

_Decoder block: Generates new language sequences._

**Token:** 

A basic unit of text, such as a word or part of a word, used as an input to language models.

**Tokenization:** 

The process of decomposing text into tokens, making it easier for AI models to process language.

**Embeddings:** 

Embeddings are numerical representations (vectors) of words or tokens that capture their semantic meanings. Each dimension in an embedding corresponds to specific attributes or relationships, meaning words frequently used in similar contexts have embeddings that are closer together. In simple terms, embeddings help AI models understand and represent relationships between words based on their usage and context.

**Foundational Model:** 

A pre-trained general model on which you can build multiple adaptive models for specialist tasks. A foundation model is a large AI model trained on a vast quantity of data designed to be adapted or fine-tuned to a wide range of downstream tasks.

**Attention:** 

Attention is a layer (in a transformer) that is used in both the encoder and decoder block. It is a technique used to examine a sequence of text tokens and try to quantify the strength of the relationship between them. In particular self-attention involves considering how other tokens around one particular token influence that token's meaning.
